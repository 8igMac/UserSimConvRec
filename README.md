This repository contains resources developed within the following paper:

> S. Zhang and K. Balog. Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems via User Simulation. In: *Proceedings of 26th SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*, August 22 - 27, 2020 - San Diego, CA - USA..

## Data

Download the movieLen dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/movie-recommender-systems/data) and put under the folder of `data`

## Bot

In this paper, we investigate serveral movie chat bots like movie bot, and chill and jmrs.

* jmrs is provided in `simulation/bot`.

* Given the access restrictions, we do not provide the wrapper for Andchill.

* Movie bot: Follow this [link](https://github.com/Sundar0989/Movie_Bot) to set up the bot for your own interest. The workspace file for training the agent on IBM lies `data/IBM_workspace.json`.
